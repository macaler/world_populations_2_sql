# world_populations_2_sql

This project is one of several Codecademy Pro Challenge Projects that I have completed. The main goal of the project was to practice SQL querying on a data set containing populations of various countries; the data base provided by Codecademy had two tables, one of country name and continent, and another containing year and population information, with countries identified by a country ID. In this project, SQL queries involving aggregate functions and JOIN clauses are utilized.

I used SQLite when completing this project.

The file "population_queries_MAC" contains the Codecademy prompts and my solutions to those prompts.

Codecademy does not say where they got the data they distributed with this project, so I will assume that I do not have permission to share that database on my own GitHub account.
